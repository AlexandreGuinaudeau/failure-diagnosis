\section*{Related Work}

% My thesis is motivated by a real-world application of incident diagnosis.
In a manufacturing plant, an aircraft, an electronic intensive care unit or a data center, many sensors continuously monitor many parameters of the environment. As more and more "smart" systems install sensors to monitor the environment, it is vital to be able to make a good use of the data.
These systems can have hundreds or thousands of sensors with sub-second sampling.
With this amount of data, diagnosing incidents requires an efficient processing of the data.
Finding the sensors that contain useful information is critical to understand the circumstances of the incident and troubleshoot it. However, there has been little work addressing the specific issue of incident diagnosis, mostly because of the sensitivity of sensor data.\\

Several tools exist to analyze the correlation between continuous time series \cite{tool-continuous}, or between events \cite{tool-event1, tool-event2, tool-event3}, but they do not perform well when it comes to correlating continuous time series and events. However, sensor data is heterogeneous: it can be continuous, discrete, categorical or binary.
Usual measures of correlation such as the Pearson and Spearman correlation do not perform well on this kind of data \cite{incident-diagnosis}. Therefore, we have to find other ways of defining correlation, or to map continuous timeseries to event timeseries to use existing tools.\\

A lot of work has been done to detect anomalies in continuous time series. Most sensor data - such as Climate \cite{climate}, Intensive Care Units \cite{icu} or computer resources \cite{incident-diagnosis} - has natural frequencies.
It is therefore possible to find pseudo-periods in the data that facilitate its pre-processing and enable multi-scale analysis \cite{multiscale-timeseries}.
In other words, the time series can be decomposed into scales, in order to detect both local \cite{anomaly-1, anomaly-2, anomaly-3} and global anomalies \cite{lof, global-local-outliers}.
Shahabi et al. even defined a surprise score that enables the comparison of all of these potential outliers, regardless of the scale \cite{multilevel-surprise}.

For categorical time series, change points are natural outliers that could induce failures in the system \cite{categorical-time-series, detect-change-points}.

Finally, raw or derived timeseries \cite{parameter-free-clustering} can be clustered in order to find timeseries that are similar to the failure time series, and therefore likely to be correlated. \\
